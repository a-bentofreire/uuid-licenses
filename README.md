## What is the uuid line?

The uuid line is defined as bellow:  
```<comment-marker><space>uuid:<space><uuid><optional-iso-date>```  
Where the:  
- comment-marker is the character sequence defined by the supported language  
   that represents the beginning of a comment   
- uuid is a character string that represents a sequence of hexadecimal numbers  
  in lowercase form, generated by a uuid algorithm,  
  with the following format:  
    ```<8 hex characters>-<4 hex characters>-<4 hex characters>-<12 hex characters>```  
 
- optional-iso-date is an optional immutable  date representing an file creation date  
  with the following format:  
    ```:<yyyy>-<MM>-<dd> <hh>:<mm>:<ss><optional-time-zone>```  
  where optional-time-zone has the following format:  
    ```Z<timezone-shift>```  

## Examples

```// uuid: c5150fc1-e4d8-41e1-9f47-6912c3ec7ea6```  
```// uuid: a172c438-5abc-4b05-9bd0-fb64e377e899:2018-02-12 10:20:30Z+01```  

## Why the need for a uuid license?

Files due refactoring change their names and locations.  
Having a uuid associated with each source code file allows tools and project managers  
to control the flow of the source code even after refactoring.  
Tools can perform git operations upon file renames, managers can better control  
the time spent working on source code files, source code database applications  
can improve their indexing algorithms, and external backup applications  
can have improved algorithms to support filename rename detection.
